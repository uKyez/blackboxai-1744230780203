# Project Overview

This project is a web application built in PHP, structured to leverage an MVC architecture. The entry point of the application is defined in `index.php`, where the application is initiated and run. It is designed to provide a scalable and organized way to handle web requests and serve dynamic content.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   (Make sure you have PHP installed on your machine.)
   - If you have Composer, you can install the dependencies as follows:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure your environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` (assuming you have environment configuration needs).

4. **Start the web server**:
   - You can use the built-in PHP server for development:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

5. **Access your application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can begin interacting with it through your web browser. The main logic resides within the `app/Core/Application.php` file, which handles routing, request processing, and response generation.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: The application is structured using the Model-View-Controller pattern for better organization and maintenance.
- **Bootstrapper**: The application initializes with a bootstrapper that sets up essential components.
- **Request Handling**: The core application class manages incoming requests and determines how to respond to them.

## Dependencies

While the specific contents of `package.json` were not provided, typical dependencies for a PHP application might include:

- PHP (>=7.4)
- Composer
- Any PHP libraries or frameworks used in this project (make sure to check `composer.json`).

Ensure all necessary packages are installed for proper functionality.

## Project Structure

Here is the general structure of the project:

```
/your-repository-name
│
├── app/
│   ├── Core/
│   │   └── Application.php         # Core application logic
│   └── other-directories/           # Additional MVC components can reside here
│
├── config/
│   ├── bootstrap.php                # Bootstrapping script
│   └── other-configuration-files/   # Additional configuration files
│
├── public/
│   └── index.php                    # Entry point for the web server
│
├── vendor/                          # Composer-managed dependencies
│
├── .env.example                     # Example environment file
├── composer.json                    # Composer dependencies
└── README.md                        # Project documentation
```

This structure facilitates a clear separation of concerns, allowing for easy navigation and development within the application.
